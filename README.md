# Access-Excel-shaarepoint-VBA
 This is an office automation, where I had created an Escalation logging system
 This uses Sharepoint for storing data in lists ( more like a table in Access)
 The calaulations are done using VBA and commited on to Sharepoint lists
 The reports are exctracted in a formatted excel file from the Sharepoint
The app also uses Outlook to send new escalation information via email.
Kindly note i am only sharing a sample of my code snippet and not sharing any data as they are propritory
You can alays reach me for any help which will be on chargable basis based on the requirement.
